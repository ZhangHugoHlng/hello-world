lyrics:
Hello world, this is me.
Life should be, fun for everyone.
Every now and then I'm insecure,
let me show you life can be so pure
Seize the day, wear a big, happy smile on your face.
On every life a little rain will fall,
that won't change my attitude at all
You are you, I am me, we'll be free.
Hello World, this is me,
Life should be, fun for everyone
Hello World, come and see,
Life should be, fun for everyone
Life is easy if you wear a smile
Just be yourself, don't ever change your style.
I like you, you like me,
Let's have fun, be happy
Look into my eyes and tell me straight
For you, I'll make the whole world wait
Let me know, if it's so, let it show
Hello World, this is me,
Life should be, fun for everyone
Hello World, come and see,
This is me
Come on baby, don't be afraid.
Come on baby, it's not too late.
Say you do, won't you open up the door,
and let me in.
Di da di, yeah.
Di, di.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Open up the door,
for me, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Mmmhh, mmhh, yeah.
Hello World, this is me,
Life should be, mmhh, mmmh, yeah, fun for everyone
Hello World, come and see,
Life should be, fun for everyone
Hello, world, this is me, fun for me,
for me, yeah, everyone.
